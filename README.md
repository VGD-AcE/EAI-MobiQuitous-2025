🚀 Fault Injection Experiments on SHAMASH and Ascon/ISAP/Sycon
This repository contains C++ source code and experiment output files used for differential fault analysis (DFA) on lightweight authenticated encryption schemes. The code supports fault injection and statistical recovery of S-box inputs under bit-stuck faults.

📁 Repository Contents
File/Folder	Description
shamashcpp.cpp	Implementation of fault injection targeting the SHAMASH cipher
main.cpp	DFA experiments for Ascon, ISAP, and Sycon using nibble-based fault models
.xlsx output	Excel results generated by each experiment (via libxl)

🛠️ Requirements
C++17 compiler

libxl (used for reading/writing .xlsx files)
Make sure to:

Link the library properly

Set your license key if using the trial version

▶️ Usage
Configure libxl (license key and paths).

Build and run main.cpp and/or shamashcpp.cpp.

Output will be saved in Excel format:

S-box values

Fault values

Round count and nibble stats

Per-trial intersection logs

Each trial evaluates how many fault injections are needed to uniquely determine all S-box inputs.

📊 Example Output
The generated .xlsx file includes:

Raw S-box input values (5-bit and faulted 4-bit)

Fault injection patterns per round

Differential output

Input recovery stats per nibble and average over 64 S-boxes

📌 Reference
This code and dataset support our submission to the
EAI MobiQuitous 2025 Conference – focused on lightweight cipher DFA evaluation.
